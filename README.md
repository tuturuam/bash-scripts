# Simple bash scripts
## mkdate
A simple script that makes a directory that uses the current date as its name.

## orgmode
A simple script that reads *org* files in the *Agenda* directory that is under /home/%user%/. If no flag is given, then the script will open a *general* agenda in Emacs. Otherwise, the flags --school (or -s) can be used to open a *school*.org file, or --work (or -w) can be used to open a *work*.org file. 

## search
A simple script that is taken from a stackoverflow answer. The program scans for SSIDs for a network device. Uses wlp3s0 as its device, but it can be changed. A change to read the user's wlan device and inputs that as the device to scan can be applied.

## tester
A simple script that uses *sivel*'s *speedtest* CLI program to add into a *JSON* *file*. The script makes a *Speedtests* directory in the user's *home* directory, and makes the *tests*.*json* file.
